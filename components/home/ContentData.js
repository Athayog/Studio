With the blessings of his gurus, his Yog practice evolved into a way of being.

His mantra is that “Yoga isn’t going to turn everyone's life around, but it has the potential to do so, you just need to be open to receiving it.”\n \nHe looks up to Swami Vivekananda, Paramahamsa Yogananda, Swami Shivananda and T Krishnamacharya for their teachings and discourses in Yoga and aspires to develop his teaching skills following in their footsteps.`,
