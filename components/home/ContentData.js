As a young teenager, he was intrigued by his grandfather’s Sadhana. He found inspiration in his grandfather’s discipline and perseverance; traits that he would acquire himself in the years to come. \n \nHis initiation into the world of Yog led him under Swami Satyananda Saraswati's teachings from Bihar School of Yoga, and a formal Yogic education from Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana. With the blessings of his gurus, his Yog practice evolved into a way of being. His intent is to share these learnings and guide people on their journey towards transformation with consistent, directed, and self-motivated effort.

Furthermore, she completed the Advance Teachers Training Course (ATTC) from Sivananda Meenakshi Ashram Madurai in January 2023 and Registered Prenatal Yoga Course (RPYT) from Athayog Living Yoga Academy Bangalore in October 2022. \n \nAfter completing TTC, Harsha worked in Sivananda Meenakshi Ashram Madurai as a volunteer staff for one year, where she assisted over six TTC batches and kids camp. Harsha believes that the ashram is one of the best places to practice and learn yoga as it helped him gain a lot of learning and spiritual experience. She learned that yoga is not just an exercise but includes punctuality, discipline, dedication, and respect for oneself and others. \n \nIn December 2021, Harsha left the ashram but still follows the teachings she learned there. After leaving the ashram, Harsha started taking online and offline classes from her home as a freelancer. She also applied for jobs in Bangalore as a yoga teacher and received a call from Athayog Living Academy, where she started her journey on July 20, 2022. Harsha is pleased with the learnings and teachings she has received from Athayog, and the academy has also given her a chance to do RPYT course (prenatal and postnatal course), which has made her more comfortable with more knowledge and teachings.`,
