One of the most common misconceptions is that “yoga is exercise”. The truth is yoga works
on multiple levels such as physical, mental, psychological and spiritual unlike physical
exercise that only focuses on the physical aspect. This is why we have to choose Yoga as
our lifestyle and not just as something we practice on the mat for an hour.`

It is an alternative system of medicine where techniques of yoga and principles of yoga are
used to prevent, promote and cure physical, mental, and psychosomatic disorders.%

vata, pitta and kapha. Different techniques of yoga help balance the doshas in order to stay
healthy. There are five sheaths of body and each one has a different function, also called as
koshas - Annamayakosha, Pranamayakosha, Manomayakosha, Vijnanamayakosha and
Anandamayakosha.%
Now that the definition of yoga therapy is clear, let's understand their yoga techniques,
principles and how they actually work or help treat various disorders.`

techniques which have to be practiced to bring balance in our Tridoshas.%
It's advisory to practice Ashtanga yoga which is mentioned in Patanjali Yoga Sutras. 
Ashtanga yoga (8 limbs) - consists of yama, niyama (lifestyle) where you have to practice
non-violence, cleanliness, self practice, self surrender, etc. The third and fourth limbs are
asana and pranayama gives physical and physiological benefits, working on different koshas
of the body. There are five sheaths of the body, each having different functions and restoring
balance for proper functioning.%
Pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi are all called antaranga yoga and works on the
subtle level, inner awareness and gives mental and spiritual benefits.`

                    desc: `Beyond the ashtanga yoga, one also has to follow a good ahaara (diet). In yoga, it is said
that mitahara (sattvika ahara) must be followed - where one fourth of the stomach should be
filled with solid, one fourth with liquid and rest should be kept empty.%
Finally, these are the yoga techniques which the therapist uses to treat different ailments
and conditions. When it comes to yoga principles, they work on trigunas, panchakoshas,
pancha pranas and tridoshas, working on subtler aspects and restoring balance in the body.%
Yoga therapy can be used as an alternative treatment for common ailments such as
headache, asthma, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, back pain, arthritis, PCOS, etc. Beyond
these, there are many more ailments which can be treated and healed with the help of Yoga
therapy.`
